Join our next in-person Security-by-Design User Group meeting on November 14th 2024. The main topic is on supply chain security and software security testing. The meeting will be held adjacent to the CyberSecurity Research and Industry Impact event, where you can see first hand how Cybersecurity research is creating an impact in the real world.

## Program:

The NIS2 standard requires that companies must have an overview of the security risks within their supply chain. Since many software developers base their software on building blocks from various external parties (programming languages and environments, open-source libraries, cloud components, etc.), one could say that, for software developers, supply chain management partly involves thoroughly documenting and tracking these dependencies in an SBOM, short for Software Bill of Materials. In this session, we will take a closer look at the concept of SBOM and review some standards and tools.

In the second part of the user group meeting, we will hear from Aikido, a leader in application security. Using the OWASP Top 10 as a guide, companies can strengthen their cybersecurity processes by shifting security efforts to earlier stages in the development cycleâ€”a practice commonly referred to as 'shift left'. Aikido will showcase tools that enable development teams to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, helping to ensure robust security measures are in place from the outset.
