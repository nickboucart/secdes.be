On September 13th, we had the pleasure of hosting a webinar featuring Professor Koen Yskout, an expert in the field of software security. The topic of the session was an introduction to threat modelling, a crucial practice for organizations aiming to build secure digital systems. The webinar attracted a wide range of participants eager to learn how to identify and mitigate potential security risks within their development processes.

Professor Yskout gave a clear and engaging overview of threat modelling, explaining its importance in todayâ€™s security landscape. He walked the audience through the basic principles and demonstrated practical approaches to uncovering vulnerabilities early in the design phase of software systems. His insights into real-world applications of threat modelling gave attendees valuable knowledge they can immediately apply in their own projects.

## What is Threat Modelling?

Threat modelling is a proactive security practice where potential threats to a system are identified, analyzed, and mitigated. The process involves understanding the architecture of a system, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and mapping out how an attacker might exploit those vulnerabilities. By addressing these risks early in the design phase, companies can reduce the likelihood of costly security incidents later on.
