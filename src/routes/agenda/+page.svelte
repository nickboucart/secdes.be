      To ensure adequate cybersecurity of hardware and software across the EU, the EU legislator has adopted many new regulations, including but not limited to NIS 2,
	   DORA, the AI Act and the Cybersecurity Act. However, the impact on those businesses, especially SMEs, remains to be seen and can constitute a major source of
	    uncertainty to conduct business in the EU. This seminar provides a bird's eye view of the new cybersecurity rules governing software, hardware and process design,

      OpenAPI specifications are more than just documentation—they can be a powerful foundation for improving your application's security. This talk explores how to 
	  effectively use OpenAPI in both code-first and spec-first workflows. We’ll discuss how well-crafted specs help uncover security issues, guide audits, and power 
	  security tools for testing, automated attacks, and even runtime protection. You'll walk away with practical insights into turning your API specs into a security
	  asset, not just a developer convenience.

      	Threat modeling sharpens the ability to spot weaknesses before attackers 
		do. This workshop focuses on building a security mindset that questions assumptions, maps out how systems really work,
		and highlights where trust could be broken. You learn to visualize data flows, identify the most critical assets, and

	  Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), with an overview of relevant standards and tools. In the second part, Aikido will present how organizations can use 
	  the OWASP Top 10 to "shift left," integrating security earlier in the development cycle. Practical demonstrations will show how development teams can 
	  detect and fix vulnerabilities proactively, strengthening security from the very beginning.

      Historically, security wasn't always a top priority for most small SaaS teams; feature development was. Upcoming legislation like NIS2, CRA, ... is 
	  increasing the pressure on the teams, not from the legislation itself, but from corporate customers who are becoming much more demanding. In this 
	  presentation we will argue that integrating security requirements early ("shifting left") should be driven by product management, as they have the 
	  best understanding of customer concerns from both feature and security perspectives. This understanding can drive investment in application security 
	  (appsec) and prioritize it on the roadmap. Product managers typically know the value of the data managed by the SaaS, whether it is crucial or 
	  peripheral to customers.

		three key areas: securing the software design phase by building security principles into architecture decisions from the start,
		implementing automated security testing to catch vulnerabilities early and continuously, and strengthening cybersecurity 
		governance to ensure compliance and accountability across the development process.
