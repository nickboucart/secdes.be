			Companies that build Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions face unique security challenges.
			Their architectures are often complex, involving multiple technologies, integrations, and
			cloud-based deployments. This complexity makes it difficult to embed robust security measures
			directly into the design. As a result, many organizations either postpone security until
			late in development or rely on ad-hoc solutions, leaving applications exposed to cyberattacks
			and data breaches.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3">
			At the same time, the pressure to demonstrate trustworthy security practices is rapidly increasing.
			Customers are becoming more vigilant about the safety of the software they use, with growing
			awareness of supply chain risks. Legislators have also raised the bar through frameworks such
			as NIS2 and CRA, requiring companies to provide evidence of how their software is secured. For
			small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those developing SaaS products, these demands
			are particularly heavy: resources are scarce, but the need to prove security maturity is urgent.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3">
			The SECDES project addresses exactly that gap. By making advanced methods from security engineering
			accessible and practical, we aim to support companies in integrating security-by-design into
			their development processes. Our goal is to lower the barriers for adopting modern, cost-efficient,
			and lightweight security approaches, enabling businesses to confidently design, test, and report
			on the security of their SaaS products. In doing so, we help them strengthen their competitiveness,
			accelerate time-to-market, and build digital services that customers can trust.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3">
			The project is aimed primarily at small and medium-sized companies in Flanders that develop and deliver SaaS
			solutions, including firms that complement physical products with online platforms. These organizations often
			have limited in-house expertise but face the same complex security challenges as larger players. By
			participating, they gain access to knowledge, tools, and guidance that would otherwise remain out of reach.

			The project revolves around three core areas that together cover the entire journey from knowledge to practice:
			building and translating expertise, offering practical tooling, and supporting effective documentation and reporting.
			By advancing in each of these areas, companies can steadily mature their security capabilities and move towards
			a full security-by-design culture.

			This focus area ensures that companies gain both awareness and actionable insights into secure software 
			development. Many organizations lack deep expertise in cybersecurity, and the tools available are often 
			documented only for simple cases, not for the complex SaaS environments in which our target group operates. 
			This project collects, structures, and translates cutting-edge research results—such as threat modeling
			methods, application analysis, and security testing techniques—into practical blueprints and case studies. 
			The emphasis lies on making complex security principles understandable and directly relevant to industry 
			needs. Through this effort, companies can learn to identify vulnerabilities early, understand trade-offs 
			between design choices, and build secure architectures that align with their business goals. By grounding 
			knowledge in realistic SaaS scenarios, we bridge the gap between academic research and day-to-day software 
			engineering practice.

			Practical Tooling
		</header>
		<section class="text-justify">
			Even with strong theoretical understanding, companies need tangible tools to put security-by-design into
			practice. The second focus area equips them with hands-on resources to secure both the architecture and 
			deployment of their applications. We provide evaluation frameworks and trade-off analyses that help 
			businesses select the right security tools for their specific environments. This includes vulnerability 
			scanners, automated testing frameworks, and methods for integrating security checks into the software 
			development life cycle. The project also delivers demonstrators that show how tools can be realistically 
			applied in cloud-based SaaS setups, making their value concrete and relatable. By lowering the learning 
			curve and tailoring the use of tools to complex architectures, we empower companies to move from theory 
			to action—detecting and mitigating risks before they can be exploited.

		<section class="text-justify">
			Security is only credible when it can be demonstrated. That is why the third focus area is dedicated to 
			documentation and reporting. Companies often struggle to present their security posture in a structured 
			and convincing way, whether towards customers, regulators, or internal stakeholders. This project supports 
			them in developing clear, standardized templates for security reporting. These cover not only the 
			architecture and design decisions, but also the testing strategies and operational safeguards in place. 
			By offering guidance on what to document and how to present it, we help businesses communicate their 
			security maturity transparently and confidently. Effective reporting not only supports compliance with 
			regulatory requirements, but also strengthens customer trust and positions companies as reliable partners 
			in the digital ecosystem.

			By lowering the barriers to adopting secure-by-design practices, this project will have a direct economic 
			and societal impact. Companies will reduce the costs and risks associated with cyber incidents, while also 
			accelerating the development of secure products. Stronger security will become a competitive advantage, 
			opening doors to international markets and shortening sales cycles. On a broader level, this project fosters 
			a culture of trust and resilience in the digital economy: as more businesses embed security into their DNA, 
			confidence in digital services grows across the ecosystem.

			We warmly invite all interested companies, partners, and stakeholders to join us in this initiative. Whether 
			you are building SaaS products, offering complementary services, or simply want to strengthen your approach
			to security, your participation will help shape a stronger and safer digital future.
