		<p><strong>Date:</strong> 13/09/2024</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Speaker:</strong> Koen Yskout
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This talk introduces 'threat modeling', one of the core techniques in the secure software
			development lifecycle. It sheds light on what threat modeling entails, where it fits in the SDLC, what benefits
			it brings, and how to get started. The talk also incorporates findings from a recent research project that 
			investigates the current state of practice in large Dutch organizations regarding threat modeling, and
			shares their lessons learned. [<a href="https://secdes.pieterp.be/2024-09-13-Threat_Modeling.mp4" target="_blank">video</a>]</li>

				Historically, security wasn't always a top priority for most small SaaS teams, feature development was. Upcoming legislation
				like NIS2, CRA, ... is increasing the pressure on the teams, not from the legislation itself, but from corporate
				customers who are becoming much more demanding. In this presentation we will argue that integrating security 
				requirements early ("shifting left") should be driven by product management, as they have the best understanding
				of customer concerns from both feature and security perspectives. This understanding can drive investment in
				application security (appsec) and prioritize it on the roadmap. Product managers typically know the value of 
				the data managed by the SaaS, whether it is crucial or peripheral to customers.

				OpenAPI specifications are more than just documentation—they can be a powerful foundation for improving your 
				application's security. This talk explores how to effectively use OpenAPI in both code-first and spec-first
				workflows. We’ll discuss how well-crafted specs help uncover security issues, guide audits, and power security
				tools for testing, automated attacks, and even runtime protection. You'll walk away with practical insights 
				into turning your API specs into a security asset, not just a developer convenience.

				To ensure adequate cybersecurity of hardware and software across the EU, the EU legislator has adopted many 
				new regulations, including but not limited to NIS 2, DORA, the AI Act and the Cybersecurity Act. However, 
				the impact on those businesses, especially SMEs, remains to be seen and can constitute a major source of 
				uncertainty to conduct business in the EU. This seminar provides a bird's
				eye view of the new cybersecurity rules governing software, hardware and process design, focusing 
				especially on the needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
